To assist with estimating the personnel requirements and options for automatic control for the fermentation plant, develop a schedule for switching the operation of the eight fermenters to provide for continuous feed to the section and appropriate circulation of mash through the heat exchangers. The schedule should identify 8-hr periods for each fermenter; the periods are for the fermenter being fed, emptied, operated adiabatically, and operated with cooling."

How much live steam must be injected to raise the temperature of this stream to 320 °F? It has been suggested that a portion of these steam requirements could be met by the vapor from the flash occurring at 15 psig. Is this feasible?

    "Our plant needs to operate 330 days a year and so employing people in varying time zones who can work remotely and accomplish various tasks would be beneficial to operating efficiency. We will also need to make sure that all technology has proper cybersecurity measures taken. I have read about too many oil/gas companies being hacked and key supply chains being shut down."

    "Some potential cultural issues we forsee include to following: If we use significant water resources, make sure that all local communities still have adequate and equitable access. We have the job of convincing the public that our plant will benefit their economy, provide jobs, and will not destroy the local environment. Plan operation delays, maintenance, and other schedules around major important holidays based on country and religious observances. Make sure that our plant is not constructed on any culturally significant locations. Our employee vacation policies should be appropriate for the location. All signs and instructions should be posted in multiple locations so all language barriers can be managed. Allow employees of various religious backgrounds time and space to practice their beliefs."

    "Similar to stated before, offering training programs to allow employees to build skills and advance in their careers is important for moral, and filling all positions at the company. Create a way for employees to get to work if they use public transportation or need to walk/bike. Monitor that all interactions between supervisors and employees are respectful. Offering flexible schedules and other initiatives can help workers with families manage their lives. Sponsoring local events is a great way to increase public perception and impact the community. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with labor laws."

Waste management and correct disposal measures are essential to reducing our environmental impact. Our plant produces CO2 and also could potentially impact air quality, soil/water quality, and more. We can run impact studies and engineer ways to scrub our pollutants. As discussed above, being compliant with OSHA is also important as well as other local regulations.\n",

    "Regarding our byproducts and leftover material, we can find a way to recycle it, use it for other purposes, and reduce trash created. We will watch as new regulations are proposed by the government and preemptively design ways to meet these criteria."

    "We will have to ensure that our plant generates enough product that we can be profitable. It is great to design all these programs to help employees and the community, as well as helping the environment. However, if the plant cannot make money then all the employees will lose their job. Creating a constant and predictable revenue stream is important to long-term well-being of the company and the plant.\n",

    "When designing the plant, to attract investors, we need to make sure the ROR on this product is sufficient to allow us to gather the funds to create the project. Managing growth projections and economic growth will be important as well. Many parts of this process will fluctuate in price including sale price of ethanol, purchase price of corn and other materials. It will be important to monitor this and try to prevent financial risks.\n",

    "Our energy costs will be a large portion of our expenses, so designing a plant that can be as efficient as possible will save us money, and reduce the impact of increasing energy costs."
