    "Write a function called \"uc\" that will convert units (\"uc\" for \"unit conversion\", \"uc\" because its short, and easy to type). The function should take a string argument. The value this string holds will determine a multiplication factor to return, which does the unit conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, If I have a variable ```x``` in units of feet, and I want to convert it to meters, I might have something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` x * uc(\"ft_to_m\") ```\n",
    "\n",

    "(a) Take what you did there, and turn it into a function called P_PR that takes as arguments the temperature in K, the molar volume in m$^3$/mol, and returns the pressure in Pa. Your function should also accept as arguments the $P_c$, $T_c$, and $\\omega$ values for a particular molecule, but should default to the values for air as was done in the original problem. Lastly, you need to test that your function is working by putting in some test values for $T$ and $V$.\n",

Demonstrate that it works by calling your function for conditions that would lead pressure to be not supercritical and supercritical."
