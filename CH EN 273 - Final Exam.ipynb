    "From an energy balance standpoint, we have work being done by the fan (to move the air around), drawing energy from the outlet (and that from outside the room). This means that the energy inside the room is increasing over time. Initially, that would be mostly velocity, but I'm sure the fan would heat up (no fan is 100% effective), and the rate of airflow would eventually level out (ie, the kinetic energy would stop increasing), which means that it's reasonable to imply that the air would eventually get warmer. As such, in a *perfectly sealed, adiabatic system* the temperature would slowly rise. This would lead me to say that the temperature **increases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the system is *not perfectly* sealed/adiabatic (just well insulated, with closed doors), and the rate at which the room would heat up seems like it would be quite small, I don't know that it actually would increase. If the impact of the fan is in the same order of magnitude as the impact of air-flow under the door or of heat transfer through the walls (which have been stated as negligible), then you could assume that it would **stay the same**. It's hard to know without knowing the Wattage of the fan, the size of the room, and the actual flow of energy into the walls/air out from under the door. So I would go with **more information needed**"
